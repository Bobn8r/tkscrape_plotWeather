# tkscrape_plotWeather
tkscrape_plotWeather uses tkinter to create a gui that displays weather from the url input on the command line.
let me try to simplify that. tkinter is used to create a window that has a canvas. On the canvas the data 
(Temperature, Humidity and Dew Point) that comes from www.weather.com is plotted. Each loop of the program pulls the data
from the weather site and plots it on the canvas.
